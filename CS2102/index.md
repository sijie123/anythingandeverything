## Database Normalization Tool
To aid my understanding of the algorithms, and to check my work, I created a normalization tool.
This tool encompasses various algorithms such as computing Keys, BCNF and 3NF given a database schema.
You can find the tool [here](https://visual.sijie123.com/sql)
Note: The tool is not properly verified and may contain bugs. Please report bugs by emailing me.
