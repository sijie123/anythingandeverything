Just some notes I took down.

### Sampling

- What makes a good sample:
  - Adequate sampling frame: *Every* unit in the target population has a probability of being selected. ("Good Coverage").
    - Sampling frame should be at least larger than Target Population, NOT smaller! This is so that we can cover all subjects and unlikely to cause bias.
    - Best if sampling frame is exactly the same as the target population. It is costly to remove unwanted units
    - Problem: Population is dynamic and changes with TIME.
  - Probability sampling frame: the process is unbiased.

- Probability Sampling plan
  - Simple random sampling: Every equal probability
  - Systematic: Intervals have equal probability
  - Stratified: Within each strata, units have equal probability
  - Cluster: Clusters have equal probability (all units in the cluster selected)
  - Multistage: Clusters have equal probability (within each cluster, units have equal probability)

- Non-probability sampling
  - Volunteer/Self-selected sampling
  - Convenience/Haphazard Sampling
  - Judgement Sampling
  - Quota Sampling


### Regression Fallacy

An analogy: Someone had a fall. The pain got worse, so he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided a little. He thought: the doctor must have been effective!
In actual fact, perhaps the pain would have subsided by itself. The pain subsiding a little is more easily explained by regression towards the mean. 
Being extremely painful is just the "exceptional" case.
Assuming the pain relief was caused by the doctor is fallacious.

### Validity, Reliability and Bias

- Validity: Are you measuring what you actually claim to measure.
  - If you get people to self-report, there are some issues:
    1. Measure by proxy. Not measuring the effect directly, but asking someone else to measure it.
    2. Self-proclaimed successes - people measure how they "feel" and not what it actually is?

- Reliability: Consistency in repeated measurements
  - Reliable measurement scheme result in measurements with low standard deviation
  - Also known as random error (true score theory)

- Bias: How much the average of measured values deviates from true value
  - Also known as systematic error (true score theory)

- True Score Theory
  - Measurement = True Value + Random Error + Systematic Error
