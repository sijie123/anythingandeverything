## Project

Source code publicly available at [Deadline Manager](https://github.com/sijie123/CS2103-deadlinemanager).

In this project, we morphed the given AddressBook into a deadline manager, supporting features like importing/exporting deadlines and a very powerful filter/search feature.

## Others

Eventually, I contributed to the official SE-EDU [AddressBook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2) and [AddressBook-level4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4) as part of CS3281.
