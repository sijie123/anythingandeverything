# CS2040 (AY17/18 Sem 2/4, AY18/19 Sem 1/2)

## Lecture notes

Lecture notes not publicly available, however [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en) has a great set of self-explanatory "e-lectures", organised into individual algorithms/data structures.

## TA Slides
I tutored CS2040/C in AY17/18 Sem 4, AY18/19 Sem 1 and 2. As part of weekly lessons, I made slides together. Some are created by myself, while some are adapted. As these slides are meant to supplement explanation, they might not be fully self-explanatory.

## VisuAlgo Online Quiz

CS2040 usually has a graded online quiz component that tests students' familarity with the theory behind data structures and algorithms.

I have compiled a cheat-sheet for some questions with known formulas. It's far from complete, though.

## Vim

As CS2040 Practical Exams do not allow IDEs, a good mastery of vim is likely helpful.
